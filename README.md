# Medication-Tapering

The Medication Tapering Calculator is a web-based tool designed to support doctors in developing medication tapering plans. It offers functionality for both standard and time-dose pair tapering methods, allowing for the input of tablet strength and tapering parameters to calculate a precise tapering schedule. This includes the total count of tablets needed and the duration of the taper.
